#  Follows WestWood 2026 startup.  Starting with 'sim'

Startup:
    MentorBot (main robot class) init is called
        Records "Robot" as logger meta data
        Does RobotMode 'match' (which we are in sim)
        Starts the logger

        Creates the RobotContainer()        # We create the robotcontainer during RobotInit

            Creates all the subsystems      # **** Does something special if in replay?
                                            #      sort of 'IO' init only...
                DriveSubsystem
                    sets  self.io = DriveIO()
                    sets  self.inputs = DriveIO.DriveIOInputs()
                    sets lots of initial values

                    if simulation.
                        creats a sim VelocityGetter. (NetworkTable subcription)   ***
                        which is tied to the 'chassis speed' function that has an
                        @autolog_output set
            Register 'Alerts'
            sets 'shiftAllerts set to true'

    RobotInit() is called'
        disables all livewindow telemetry
        sets up Command auto-log capabilities for initialize finish and interrupt

        sets up some pathplanner logging
